# CCI-Fair-July-2022
My repo for the July 2022 CCI Fair.

This year, my project for the CCI Fair was "SuperResNet: The Ultimate Image Enhancer". Run app.py for the website, and you can find the model in tensorflow hub [here](https://tfhub.dev/captain-pool/esrgan-tf2/1). The goal of my project is to enhance blurry images. Note: This model doesn't work well on pixelated samples. I hope you like the project.

Happy Coding, Vihan
